                Golden Retrievers are known for their sweet disposition and desire to be near their owners.
                They are naturally bred to retrieve whatever their owners desire and love to please. Beautiful dogs known
                for their iconic golden coat; one is hard-pressed to think of a better companion at your side every day.
